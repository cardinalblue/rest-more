## A simple interactive shell with [rib][]:

You need to install [rib][] in order to try this interactive shell:

    gem install rib

Then you can try this by running `rib rest-core`:

    rest-core>> self.site = 'https://api.github.com/users/'
    rest-core>> self.json_decode = true
    rest-core>> get 'cardinalblue'

Which is using `RestCore::Universal` for accessing arbitrary websites.
